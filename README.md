### This is a project which helps the end users draw graphs and visualize algorithms on them. It is bootstrapped using ```create-react-app``` and is created using TypeScript.

## Features:-
* Creation, deletion and movement of graph nodes.
* Creation, deletion and weight modification of graph edges.
* Visualization of Algorithms.

## Algorithms supported:-
* Breadth First Search Traversal.
* Depth First Search Traversal.
* Dijkstra Path Finding Algorithm.
